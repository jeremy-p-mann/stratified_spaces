The goal of this hobby project is to introduce the reader to the wonderful
theory of stratified spaces and realize clinical ontologies (e.g. SNOMED,
OMOP's standardized vocabularies, etc.) (more generally certain graphical 
databases) in terms of stratified spaces.

Such a realization would have two primary benfits. First, it will put
constructions, such as ancestries, in terms which are independent of a
particular query language or database provider. I hope that it will also give a
geometric defition of a schema for graphical databases.
